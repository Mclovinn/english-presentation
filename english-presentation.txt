Enduro Motocross

Good morning everyone

My name is Agustin, I am a Software Developer and a motocross passionate.
I have worked for Ascentio for 2 years  and I have ridden motorcycle since 1995
when my dad gave me my first motorcycle when I was 5.

Today I'd like to talk about my experience in enduro.
For this I'm going to divide this presentation into three parts:
    * First, I will tell you what Enduro is
    * Then, I will continue with the different types of Enduro
    * And finally the conclusion

Ok, lets start..

Enduro is a form of motorcycle sport run on courses that are mostly off-road. For
example in the mountain with a lot of obstacles like a rocks, tree roots, rivers,
etc. To finish explaining this I'd like to show you some photos.

Okey, if this topic is clear I'm moving on now to the different types of enduro.
Exist some types to practice enduro:
    * Off-road: like the example that I already presented to you. This is generally
        practiced like a hobby.
    * Indoor: Is a circuit with some obstacles. Let me show you (video).
        In this modality the time of the lap is controlled and the racer with minor
        time wins.
    * Outdoor: It is the same modality of Indoor but the circuit is made off-road (video)

Right, let's sum up, shall we?
There are a lot of ways to practice Enduro. I presented to you only three but I think
it is enough to know about this sport.
Personally I love to drive off-road with my friends and my dad, because nobody hurries
you up, you can stop to see the nature or take a little break whenever you want. Yo can
run fast or you can run slow, you can race and play with your friends, etc.

So, I won't bore you anymore, please feel free to ask questions.
